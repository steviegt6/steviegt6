# Hey there, I'm [tomat](https://tomat.dev/).

I program and develop mods for games in my free time. I like programming and reverse engineering, problem solving is fun. I have a presence mainly in the Terraria modding community, but I have dabbled in Minecrat, Stardew Valley, and HoloCure.

## Like what I do?

or consider contacting me through a service (preferably Discord, `@tomat`) for commissions.
