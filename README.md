I'm a programmer who writes software; sometimes useful, sometimes video game modifications. I've a fascination for reverse engineering and doing things with software that I probably shouldn't.

## Like what I do?

That's awesome, consider donating:

- [Patreon](https://patreon.com/steviegt6),
- [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/steviegt6).

You are in no way obligated to do so, of course, but every bit helps me escape from working at Walmart.
