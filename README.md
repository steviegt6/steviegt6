# Hey there, I'm [tomat](https://tomat.dev/).

---

I'm a programmer and game modder who enjoys reverse-engineering and other nerd stuff like that. I'm known in the Terraria modding community and somewhat exist in the Minecraft modding community. I develop and maintain my own projects as well as several mods for Terraria.

I know **C#**; **Java**; **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**; and **TypeScript** - among other things.

Quite a large fan of archival, practically everything I make program probably be kept here if possible. Advocate for free software, willing to settle for open-source.

<!-- ## Projects
I actively work on and have worked on several projects in the past, including, but not limited to:
* [**Felt**](https://github.com/feltpowered/felt), and other projects under the [_FeltPowered_](https://github.com/feltpowered) organization, which work in unison to create a "universal" mod loader and runtime patcher for C# applications.
* [**Terraclient**](https://github.com/Steviegt6/Terraclient), a utility client for Terraria (no longer maintained, not fun to work on). This made use of tModLoader's patching system.
* [**TML.Patcher**](https://github.com/Steviegt6/TML.Patcher), a program for unpacking and manipulating `.tmod` files, designed to heavily aid in reverse-engineering mods.
* [**CataclysmMod**](https://github.com/Steviegt6/CataclysmMod), an experimental Terraria mod which makes heavy use of interesting assembly loading manipulation and knowledge of how the CLR understands type loading to achieve add-on functionality.
* [**Terraprisma**](https://github.com/rejuvena/terraprisma), a tModLoader bootstrapper which enabled the use of assembly transformation before tML loaded, akin to Minecraft's coremodding.
* [**Tea Framework**](https://github.com/rejuvena/tea-framework), a progressive modding library and framework for tModLoader mods.
* [**Rejuvena**](https://github.com/rejuvena/rejuvena), an advanced content mod for Terraria. -->
