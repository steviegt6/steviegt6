# Hey there, I'm [tomat](https://tomat.dev/).

> [tomat.dev](https://tomat.dev) - `@tomat` // `@tomat:matrix.org`

---

I am a hobbyist software developer who develops mods for video games and general programs. I enjoy programming, problem solving, reverse engineering, and other things of that nature. I have a presence in the Terraria modding community and have some footing in the Minecraft, Stardew Valley, and HoloCure modding scenes as well. Most of what I develop is my own, but I am always glad to contribute where possible.

I am versed in a multitude of different languages and technologies. You can take a look at my projects to see what I use more often, but not everything is represented there.

A large fan of archival, practically everything I develop should wind up here eventually. I like open-source software, I prefer free software, and I like earning money and getting paid for my work.

## Like what I do?

<!-- ## Projects
I actively work on and have worked on several projects in the past, including, but not limited to:
* [**Felt**](https://github.com/feltpowered/felt), and other projects under the [_FeltPowered_](https://github.com/feltpowered) organization, which work in unison to create a "universal" mod loader and runtime patcher for C# applications.
* [**Terraclient**](https://github.com/Steviegt6/Terraclient), a utility client for Terraria (no longer maintained, not fun to work on). This made use of tModLoader's patching system.
* [**TML.Patcher**](https://github.com/Steviegt6/TML.Patcher), a program for unpacking and manipulating `.tmod` files, designed to heavily aid in reverse-engineering mods.
* [**CataclysmMod**](https://github.com/Steviegt6/CataclysmMod), an experimental Terraria mod which makes heavy use of interesting assembly loading manipulation and knowledge of how the CLR understands type loading to achieve add-on functionality.
* [**Terraprisma**](https://github.com/rejuvena/terraprisma), a tModLoader bootstrapper which enabled the use of assembly transformation before tML loaded, akin to Minecraft's coremodding.
* [**Tea Framework**](https://github.com/rejuvena/tea-framework), a progressive modding library and framework for tModLoader mods.
* [**Rejuvena**](https://github.com/rejuvena/rejuvena), an advanced content mod for Terraria. -->
