---

I'm a programmer who especially enjoys developing mods for software -- especially video games -- in my free time. I've a fascination for reverse engineering and doing things with software that I probably shouldn't.

I exist namely in the Terraria modding community but have dabbled elsewhere.

## Like what I do?

That's awesome, consider donating:

- [Patreon](https://patreon.com/tomatophile),

or consider contacting me through a service (preferably Discord, `@tomat`) for commissions.
